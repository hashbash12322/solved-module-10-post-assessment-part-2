<strong>Person</strong> and <strong>Customer</strong> Classes

Design a class named <strong><sub>Person</sub></strong> with fields for holding a person’s name, address, and telephone number. Write one or more constructors and the appropriate mutator and accessor methods for the class’s fields.

Next, design a class named <strong><sub>Customer</sub></strong>, which extends the <strong><sub>Person</sub></strong> class. The <strong><sub>Customer</sub></strong> class should have a field for a customer number and a <strong><sub>boolean</sub></strong> field indicating whether the customer wishes to be on a mailing list. Write one or more constructors and the appropriate mutator and accessor methods for the class’s fields. Demonstrate an object of the <strong><sub>Customer</sub></strong> class in a simple program.

<h1>PreferredCustomer Class</h1>

A retail store has a preferred customer plan where customers can earn discounts on all their purchases. The amount of a customer’s discount is determined by the amount of the customer’s cumulative purchases in the store as follows:

<ul>

 <li>When a preferred customer spends $500, he or she gets a 5 percent discount on all future purchases.</li>

 <li>When a preferred customer spends $1,000, he or she gets a 6 percent discount on all future purchases.</li>

 <li>When a preferred customer spends $1,500, he or she gets a 7 percent discount on all future purchases.</li>

 <li>When a preferred customer spends $2,000 or more, he or she gets a 10 percent discount on all future purchases.</li>

</ul>

Design a class named <strong>PreferredCustomer</strong>, which extends the <strong>Customer</strong> class you created above. The <strong><sub>PreferredCustomer</sub></strong> class should have fields for the amount of the customer’s purchases and the customer’s discount level. Write one or more constructors and the appropriate mutator and accessor methods for the class’s fields. Demonstrate the class in a simple program.
